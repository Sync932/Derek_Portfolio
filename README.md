Hi, I'm Derek. I use data to solve real business problems. The projects below were created using real world data in professional settings. Each one is designed to save time, increase efficiency, and make life easier for decision-makers.

All confidential information has been anonymized or modified to protect employer agreements. However, the trends and structural insights remain true to the original data.

### [Grant Recipient Info](https://github.com/Sync932/Derek_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Grant%20Recipient%20Info.png) 
* :briefcase: Business Context: This project was developed for a nonprofit farmers market where I serve as a private contractor. Through direct consultation with the board president, I identified a need for centralized, structured reporting to support decisions around vendor behavior, customer engagement, and grant forecasting.
* :fire: My Challenge:  Clean, structure, and transform multiple raw datasets into an actionable Excel-based dashboard
* :bulb: Insights: The vendor scorecard system revealed patterns in attendance, sales performance, and behavioral compliance guiding proactive conversations and vendor support strategies.
* :dollar: Outcome: This dashboard is actively in use and continues to inform board decisions. It highlights areas for operational improvement, vendor engagement, and equitable grant allocation.

# [Project 2: Geographic Category Review](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/derek2697/viz/Project_16792940348160/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
## [SQL code for Tableau](https://github.com/Sync932/Derek_Portfolio/blob/main/Geographic%20SQL.txt) 
* :briefcase: Business Context: The company was experiencing an acquisition of another complimentary brand and was looking to get a well rounded sense of what did well on their product categories and where they should focus efforts to sell that company's products with strategic sales placement.
* :fire: My Challenge: Utilize SQL and Tableau to look at a 50k+ line dataset of a real order history spanning two years to find insights on what sold well and what did not and where.
* :bulb: Insights: Gaming goods were easily the largest category, selling primarily in Washington and Kentucky. 
* :dollar: Outcome: lists by collection were grouped to geographic regions to aid the purchasing team in distribution efforts.

# [Project 3: Inventory Analysis](https://github.com/Sync932/Derek_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Inventory%20Analysis.png)
* :briefcase: Business Context: This project came during a time for the company where operations knew space was being wasted but was not sure what to do about it or how to find the product that was not turning over.
* :fire: My Challenge: utilize excel and Power BI to take close to 40k products spread across three different companies and perform an ABC/inventory health analysis for the whole company.
* :bulb: Insights: (being reviewed and updated actively)
* :dollar: Outcome: Lists were drawn from the lowest moving products which were then given to the marketing and E-commerce teams to give them a jumping point for product sales and clearance to motivate increased sales.

# [Project 4: Price Quote Generator](https://github.com/Sync932/Derek_Portfolio/blob/main/VBA%20Quote%20Generator.txt)
### [Generated Report](https://github.com/Sync932/Derek_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Quote%20Generator%20Front%20Page.png)
### [Report Interface](https://github.com/Sync932/Derek_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Quote%20Generator%20Controls.png)
* :briefcase: Business Context: The sales team annually and upon request sends updated pricing lists by sku to every customer or distributor, a process which before changes were made took upwards of 40 minutes for an individual to manually complete per account, costing them weeks of dedicated effort in preparation for the new year.
* :fire: My Challenge: utilize a combination of VBA and insightsoftware Jet Reports to query data live from a company ERP system, and assemble a full item list of products, item information, and current pricing at the press of a button, formatting and arranging everything to be presentation ready for retail customers.
* :bulb: Insights: This process was filled with natural human error, complicated back and forth, exporting lots of spreadsheets to compare with each other, and was being handled by the sales assistant who was out of commission every time this task came up.
* :dollar: Outcome: The revised process involved a dashboard of price level buttons which upon being selected, would draft a full sku list with correct pricing in approximately 5 seconds, opening dozens if not hundreds of labor hours both at the beginning of the year and over time as new requests came in after the initial push.

# [Project 5: Price Adjustment Automation](https://github.com/Sync932/Derek_Portfolio/blob/main/VBA%20Price%20Adjustment.txt)
* :briefcase: Business Context: Throughout the year certain customers would receive special sales on groups of skus, and the sales assistant was tasked with sku by sku updating the pricing in batches of sometimes hundreds at a time, across a customer portfolio of hundreds of accounts. 
* :fire: My Challenge: utilize VBA to take a submitted list of items that need to have updated pricing and uploaded into a company ERP system, implimenting only the new data as needed into the current price structure of that particular customer. 
* :bulb: Insights: This process was an intense burden on the sales team, eating up time and taking away the assistant to the sales VP who was already overloaded with their own work, leaving everyone in suboptimal ability to rise to proactively address new challenges. 
* :dollar: Outcome: The updated report template allowed these changes to be made within a few seconds of hitting a button, removing human error, and streamlining the process from an original processing time of one to several hours per customer or group of customers.
