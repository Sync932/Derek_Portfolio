Hi, I'm Derek. I use data to solve real business problems. Below are a few handpicked projects designed to save time, increase efficiency, and make life easier for decision makers. All projects are created using actual job related data needed for real applications. Please note that all confidential data has been altered beyond recognition in order to maintain employer confidentiality agreements, however the trends between the data points themselves remain intact. 


# [Project 1: Inventory Analysis](https://github.com/Sync932/Derek_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Inventory%20Analysis.png)
* :briefcase: Business Context: This project came during a time for the company where operations knew space was being wasted but was not sure what to do about it or how to find the product that was not turning over.
* :fire: My Challenge: utilize excel and Power BI to take close to 40k products spread across three different companies and perform an ABC/inventory health analysis for the whole company.
* :bulb: Insights: (review and update)
* :dollar: Outcome: Lists were drawn from the lowest moving products which were then given to the marketing and E-commerce teams to give them a jumping point for product sales and clearance to motivate increased sales

* Business Context: The company was experiencing an acquisition of another complimentary brand and was looking to get a well rounded sense of what did well on their product lines and where they should focus the physical reallocation of that company's products from their facility into our various warehouses for strategic sales placement.
* My Challenge: Utilize SQL and Tableau to look at a 50k+ line dataset of a real order history spanning two years to find insights on what sold well and what did not and where.
